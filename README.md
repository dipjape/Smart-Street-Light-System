# Smart-Street-Light-System
Smart street light refers to a network-connected street light. Each street light is equipped with an outdoor lamp controller, internet of things device, and/ or sensors. A smart street light automatically regulates the light intensity based on sunset/ sunrise times, daily schedule, human presence, traffic, and/ or weather situation. Thereby saving considerable energy and lowering the maintenance costs. Smart street lights also capture and transmit data in near real-time to a central management system, so that street light operator gets:

* Total control over each luminaire,
* Insight into the state of public lighting, and
* Access to a range of lighting applications and services

## How do Smart Street Lights Work?
A smart street light automatically regulates the light intensity of the connected street light based on a smart algorithm and inputs from external sensors. Such inputs include local sunset/ sunrise times, daily light level schedule, pre-programmed light scene, human presence, traffic, and/ or weather situation.

To achieve this, a conventional or LED street light is typically equipped with an outdoor lamp controller (OLC). The main purpose of this controller is to send and receive commands to/ from the connected street light. Such commands include switching, dimming, scheduling, and maintenance messages.

## Benefits of Smart Street Lighting
Smart street lights are a cost-effective, practical, and sustainable way to minimize energy usage and expenses. Smart street lights also improve the quality of life and citizen safety in the community by alerting the lighting operator in time for a prompt repair where necessary.

The notable benefits of smart street lights include:

1)  60% to 80% energy savings over-and-above the savings achieved through conversion to LED streetlights.
2) Full control over public lighting infrastructure.
3) Turn reactive maintenance to predictive maintenance through smart alarms and advance notifications. Thereby reducing considerable operating costs.
4) Significant improvements in public safety by offering high-quality illumination and helping the operator keep the lighting infrastructure up-to-date. Motion sensor street lights further improve public safety perception.
5) Cut light pollution, and protect local flora and fauna â€“ by dimming the street lights during off-peak hours or through motion sensors.
6) Automatic switching ON and OFF of street lights.
7) Cost-effective

## Components Used :
##### 1) Arduino UNO :
Arduino UNO is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P. It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz ceramic resonator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started.

##### 2) Relay : 
A relay is an electrically operated switch. It consists of a set of input terminals for a single or multiple control signals, and a set of operating contact terminals. The switch may have any number of contacts in multiple contact forms, such as make contacts, break contacts, or combinations thereof.

Relays are used where it is necessary to control a circuit by an independent low-power signal, or where several circuits must be controlled by one signal.

##### 3) LED :
A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor device that emits light when an electric current flows through it. When current passes through an LED, the electrons recombine with holes emitting light in the process. LEDs allow the current to flow in the forward direction and blocks the current in the reverse direction. a semiconductor device that emits infrared or visible light when charged with an electric current. Visible LEDs are used in many electronic devices as indicator lamps, in automobiles as rear-window and brake lights, and on billboards and signs as alphanumeric displays or even full-colour posters.
